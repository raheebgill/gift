          <h2>You Are One OF My Best Friends</h2>
          
          <p>Dear Amina,</p>
          <p>
            As we get ready to step into a new year, I can't help but think about all the times we've shared. You've been with me through thick and thin, like a true friend. Pablo Neruda once wrote about finding beauty in the ordinary, and that's exactly what our friendship is â€“ extraordinary in its simplicity. From everyday moments to the special ones, each laugh, tear, and secret shared has added a new chapter to our story.
          </p>
          <p>
            T.S. Eliot wondered about time and life, and looking back, I cherish the moments we've created together. As we approach a new year, I wish we meet a lot this year and make more memories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's to more adventures, more laughs, and more memories in the upcoming year. I'm grateful for our friendship and excited to see what the future holds.
          </p>
          <p>Wishing you a fantastic New Year!</p>
          <p className="signature">With love, Raheeb Gill</p>
